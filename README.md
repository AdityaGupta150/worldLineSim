# World Line Simulator
=======================

Wait... if you are thinking it's some big rendering project, sorry but it's not,
it enjoys this condition ->

_Think about a world, in which 4 snakes keep moving automatically to get food_

And, here's what this project adds ->
_And... you can go to a particular time in **past**, and change the position of one of the snakes... Baammm, a new world line is created in which this event happened, and the older world had the event not taken place... so there is a high chance, current state(lengths of the snakes) of the world will be different than what had been in the previous world line_

That's it, this project does this much mainly (though no limitations on what it may add later).

It also features a constantly growing matrix (the world_plot).

### Compiling
NA - Not complete for a successful compile yet

### NOTE - 
Initially the focus is that _internally_ the simulation happens, but you can't see it (Since, I don't have a ground in rendering things currently, if you have ideas, or suggestions do put in that pinned issue)
