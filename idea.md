A parallel world simulator... similar to snakes game, just that there are 4 snakes. Now each chases the food, and as such, each others presence matters, and as one gets food, its value incremented by one, so each 'action'(only one action in this world, that is to grab food), Two things the program does -> Remove a snake, this creates another graph(ie. a world), and simulates it from the origin point,(ie. each has 0 points), without presence of the removed one, and we get the situation at current (which will definitely be different, since the chances of the action being done by one is 1/3rd instead of 1/4th. The second action is... chose a snake, chose a time point (like 3 food earlier), and then chose a position, at which the snake should have been at that time... this action creates another graph(ie. a world), `from that point of time, it will rerender through actions and give the situation at current point`, this world 'can' be different (degree of difference, the divergence number varies, according to chosen position is likely to give it the most food in future moves (future to that chosen past, and is actually the present)).... this is how it works. It may seem simple, but indeed GREAT :D !!
